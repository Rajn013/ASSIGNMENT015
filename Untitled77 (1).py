# What are the new features added in Python 3.8 version?
# 

# 1. Assignment Expressions (walrus operator): Allows assigning values within expressions using `:=`.
# 2. Positional-only Parameters: Parameters that can only be passed by position, not by keyword.
# 3. Improved f-strings: Supports `=` specifier for quick debugging.
# 4. math.prod(): Computes the product of elements in an iterable.
# 5. statistics.mode(): Calculates the mode (most common value) in a sequence of numbers.
# 6. Improved Syntax Warnings: More informative warnings for syntax errors.
# 7. __future__.annotations: Controls the evaluation of annotations.
# 8. functools.lru_cache(): Provides a cache for function calls based on least-recently-used strategy.

# What is monkey patching in Python?
# 

# Monkey patching in Python refers to the practice of modifying or extending the behavior of an existing module, class, or object at runtime. It allows you to add, replace, or modify attributes, methods, or functions of an object without changing its original source code. Essentially, monkey patching allows you to dynamically change the behavior of objects in your code without the need for inheritance or subclassing.

# What is the difference between a shallow copy and deep copy?
# 

# The difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy lies in how they handle nested objects or collections:
# 
# Shallow Copy: Creates a new object and copies the references of nested objects. Changes made to the nested objects will be reflected in both the original and copied objects.
# 
# Deep Copy: Creates a new object and recursively copies all the nested objects, creating separate copies. Changes made to the nested objects will not affect the original object or other copied objects.

# What is the maximum possible length of an identifier?
# 

# The maximum length of an identifier is not explicitly defined. However, there are some practical limitations to consider. The Python style guide, known as PEP 8, suggests limiting identifiers to a maximum of 79 characters for readability. Additionally, some Python implementations or systems may impose their own limitations on identifier length. In general, it is recommended to keep identifiers concise and meaningful to enhance code readability.

# What is generator comprehension?
# 

# Generator comprehension is a way to generate values on-the-fly using a compact syntax, saving memory by producing values one at a time.
